      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Over 18 years experience in a variety of industries, developing distributed systems and web
          applications. I am passionate about improving the way that software is developed, with a particular
          focus on simplicity and quality. I have plenty of experience of delivering high-quality applications
          which have been developed in a sustainable manner.</p>
        <p>I like to work on simple systems, refactoring ruthlessly to evolve the design. I’m a big believer
          in starting small, demoing & releasing often, and iterating based on user feedback.</p>
        <p>In 2008 I began learning Scala, in 2009 I used it on a small production application, and at Sky
          I introduced it to the team, switching all new development to Scala. In recent years I have enjoyed
          learning pure functional programming in Haskell. Through this journey I have found that fully utilising
          the type system results in clearly documented code, that is simple to test and easy to reason about.
          At Deutsche Bank I championed Haskell and Elm for two production applications, which was well
          received within the team.</p>

          <p>Developed a front-office application for the lifecycle management of trades within Structured Finance. The project consisted 
            of a small team of developers, responsible for talking to senior members of the business,
            building the system to capture the transactions, and supporting it in production. The project has been a large success,
            and we had a good relationship with front and middle office.
          </p>
          <p>On this application I championed a number of technologies within the team. The front-end was a single page app 
            written in ScalaJS (on top of React). This allowed us to shared data types, safely refactor across the entire stack, 
            and write some pretty amazing abstractions to scrap boilerplate code. The server was written in functional scala using Typelevel libraries.
          </p>
          <p>I was also on a team tasked to develop a workflow system for rates
            exotics sales and trading. We began with a small prototype, which was shown to traders and
            iterated upon.</p>

            Part of a small team to rewrite an application to communicate with telephone switches. I was the
            main driver behind the team adopting Scala. I wrote a port our chosen acceptance
            testing framework to run with Specs2 tests, which I maintain on Github and has a number of
            users outside of Sky.</p>
          <p>I also lead the development of rewriting an address matching application, using Lucene, Scala, Scalaz,
            Dispatch and Spray, which was delivered ahead of all estimates, despite most of the team having
            to come up to speed on Scala. The application is written in a pure functional style and has no
            exceptions, no 'if' statements and had only one small bug once going live. It has a full set of
            automated tests and can be deployed to production in minutes.</p>

            Developing the reporting tools for Wiley's online library. Billing
            is based on aggregated usage statistics to various pieces of content, therefore timely and accurate statistics
            are important. We collected, normalised and stored access information in a distributed data grid,
            then aggregated in multiple dimensions. Because the system was asynchronous and distributed, testing
            it comprehensively posed a challenge to the team, so my experience in this area proved useful.</p>

          <p>I was contracted replace a telephone provisioning system, written in Oracle PL/SQL, that was scaling poorly with increased subscribers. Rather than completely discard the existing system, we designed the new system in such a way that provisioning events would be routed through the existing workflow system until the replacement workflow had been developed. This allowed us to deploy very early in the project, gaining rapid feedback and allowing the business to quickly see return on their investment.</p>
