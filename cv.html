      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Over 20 years experience in many different industries, developing distributed systems and web
          applications. I am passionate about improving the way that software is developed, with a particular
          focus on simplicity and quality. I have plenty of experience of delivering high-quality applications
          which have been developed in a sustainable manner.</p>
        <p>
          I use iterative planning methods, test driven development and pair programming to improve the design, testability and
          maintainability of software. I have introduced these methods into organisations for almost two decades in a
          developer and team-lead capacity.</p>
        <p>I have over 10 years experience growing small high performing teams of engineers who enjoying working together, 
          iterately delivering value to clients.</p>

              I lead a four-person team developing a new structured notes sales platform. Rather than develop the platform in isolation, we began by finding existing sales and trading users, tried to understand the challenges they faced, and built systems to improve their efficiency. 
              To date, we have replaced the existing error prone Excel pricing spreadsheet with a web UI, and automated the generation of term-sheets. The resulting increase in sales year-over-year has been attributed to the automation.
            </p> 
            <p>We are a small, co-located team, with a large degree of autonomy over technical and project management decisions. Our technology stack is functional Scala using Typelevel libraries, with Typescript and ReactJS to build the UI. To minimise risk and improve our ability to react to changes, we completely automated our continuous delivery pipeline, enabling production releases twice a week. </p>

          <p>Developed a front-office application for the lifecycle management of trades within Structured Finance. The project consisted 
            of a small team of developers, responsible for talking to senior members of the business,
            building the system to capture the transactions, and supporting it in production. The project has been a large success,
            and we had a good relationship with front and middle office.
          </p>
          <p>On this application I championed a number of technologies within the team. The front-end was a single page app 
            written in ScalaJS (on top of React). This allowed us to share data types, safely refactor across the entire stack, 
            and write some pretty amazing abstractions to scrap boilerplate code. The server was written in functional scala using Typelevel libraries.

            Part of a small team to rewrite an application to communicate with telephone switches. I was the
            main driver behind the team adopting Scala. To meet the needs of the business, I authored a Scala end-to-end  
            testing framework, which I maintained on Github and was well used outside of Sky.</p>
          <p>I also lead the engineering to rewrite an address matching application, using Lucene, Scala, Scalaz,
            Dispatch and Spray, which was delivered ahead of all estimates, despite most of the team having
            to come up to speed on Scala. The application is written in a pure functional style and has no
            exceptions, no 'if' statements and had only one small bug once going live. It has a full set of
            automated tests and can be deployed to production in minutes.</p>
